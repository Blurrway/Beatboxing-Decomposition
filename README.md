# Beatboxing-Decomposition
An ongoing effort to decompose solo beatboxing performances into their individual sounds with Python. Created by Sidney Cozier and Ankoor Apte as a Final Project for E190AP (Music Signals Processing) at Harvey Mudd College.

Part of this project involves collecting a large database of sounds and recordings from various different beatboxers. If you're also a beatboxer, feel free to help contribute to this database! You can find instructions in the recording_procedure document. You don't necessarily have to do every single recording, but the more recordings the better! More instructions may be added in the future if we decide to add sounds to the database.
