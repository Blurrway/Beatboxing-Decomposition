# Music Signal Processing Fall 2018 Final Project Recording Procedure and Instructions
Thank you for agreeing to participate in this experiment! Below are the
some instructions on what to record. We would like to get a total of 10
recordings from you. This should take under 20 minutes to complete
(hopefully). If you have any questions at any point in the process,
please contact one of us (Sidney Cozier
([scozier\@g.hmc.edu](mailto:scozier@g.hmc.edu)) or Ankoor
Apte ([aapte\@g.hmc.edu](mailto:aapte@g.hmc.edu))). We
hope that this will be a fun, relaxed recording session for you!

**Here are some important guidelines on the recording process:**

-   While our system may be able to handle some amount of noise in recordings, noise filtering is not really within the intent or scope of the current project. As such, we ask for you to **please record in a quiet environment with minimal ambient noise**.

-   You can record with either a full microphone setup or with a good recording application on your phone, as long as the **sampling rate is at least 44.1 kHz** (if you used higher than this, please let us know). Also, please check to make sure that the **audio is not severely clipped and/or that the mic doesn't receive too much air from your sounds** (a pop filter is recommended to help with this, but it's not absolutely necessary). If we think the audio quality is too poor to work with, we may ask for a re-recording.

-   Even if you feel like you have very good rhythm, **please use a metronome unless otherwise indicated**. Our system may rely on a consistent tempo throughout the recording, so sticking to the beat is imperative. To avoid hearing the metronome in the recording, please listen to it through headphones (at low volume if you're using earbuds with significant sound leakage). \[Make sure you know if the recording application is using the phone mic or the headphone mic, as headphone mics can sometimes give considerably lower quality audio\]

-   For ease of data management, we would like you to save your files with the following format: **\[First initial\]\[Last Name\]\_rec\[recording \#\].wav**, where the recording numbers are given below. For example, Sidney's recording 4 would be submitted as a file named "scozier\_rec4.wav". You may also want to send all of the recordings in a single zip file, since this may be a large amount of data to send over email.

-   These instructions use a notation based on Standard Beatboxing Notation (SBN) to notate the sounds and beat patterns. Check out [this webpage](https://www.humanbeatbox.com/articles/standard-beatbox-notation-sbn/) for more information. For beat patterns, the basic concept is that 1 measure is enclosed by braces ({}), quarter note divisions are represented by slashes (/), and rests are represented by hyphens (-). Time signatures are marked individually for clarity, but everything here is in 4/4 time (i.e. 4 quarter-note beats per measure).

That's it for the formalities, have fun recording!

Sound Dictionary
================

These are all of the sounds that we will be testing, so all of the
recordings will only have sounds from this list (this also means
avoiding humming while making these sounds). If possible, we would like
for you to use your interpretation of the sound, or how you would create
the sound in a performance. Don't stress over making the sound
"perfect"; the point is to capture the individuality in how different
people perform these sounds. If you aren't sure what sound the letter is
referring to, we have provided audio samples of what our version of the
sound sounds like (TODO); however, we would prefer that you listen to
these *only* if you don't know what the sound is. If you feel like you
don't know how to make the sound at all, please talk to one of us about
it. The letters of the sounds are all based on the phonetic structure of
the sound (again, see [this page](https://www.humanbeatbox.com/articles/standard-beatbox-notation-sbn/) for details), so if you try to sound it out, you might be closer than you think!

1.  Kick - B

2.  Snare 1 - Pf

3.  Snare 2 - Pch

4.  Snare 3 - K

5.  [Snare 4 - \^Ksh](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-0lmhqXw0JB6BJtoiiJzMVoo5UxpBVwK) (throat-based hit, NOT the tongue-based hit)

6.  [Snare roll - rrh](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TafpcAqCd1V35rcwilZcdodcZk7SXdu8)

7.  Closed hi-hat - t

8.  Open hi-hat/crash/cymbal - ts *OR* dsh

9.  [Rimshot - k](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yfNHtz0qB0O1ZYFPZNZiRY0qLY2vXbDC)

10. [Lip oscillation (single tone) - PP *OR* BB](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1O721qpP33x9IzYm-vk9tVzcXdjB-KWa1)

Recording 1: Individual Sounds
==============================

Recording of each sound in the dictionary, once per measure, for four
measures. The sounds are notated below as quarter notes, but feel free
to let them last up to a half-note interval. This will ensure that the
sounds do not fade into each other.

**4/4 time, 120 bpm**

{B/-/-/-}{B/-/-/-}{B/-/-/-}{B/-/-/-}

{Pf/-/-/-}{Pf/-/-/-}{Pf/-/-/-}{Pf/-/-/-}

{Pch/-/-/-}{Pch/-/-/-}{Pch/-/-/-}{Pch/-/-/-}

... \[Cycle through each sound in order\]

{k/-/-/-}{k/-/-/-}{k/-/-/-}{k/-/-/-}

{BB/-/-/-}{BB/-/-/-}{BB/-/-/-}{BB/-/-/-}

Recordings 2-4: Beat Pattern 1
==============================

Please record this beat pattern at three different tempos: 80 bpm
(rec2), 100 bpm (rec3), and 140 bpm (rec4). Here we introduce \|\| as a
repeat symbol for the entire line.

**4/4 time, 80/100/140 bpm**

{ B t / K t / t B / Pf t }{ t B / Pch t / t B / \^Ksh t } \|\|

Recordings 5-7: Beat Pattern 2
==============================

Similarly, record this beat pattern at 80 bpm (rec5), 100 bpm (rec6),
and 140 bpm (rec7)

**4/4 time, 80/100/140 bpm**

{ B ts / Pch tk / B rrh / Pch }{ B ts / Pch tk / BB / Pch } \|\|

Recording 8: Beat Pattern 3
===========================

This time, we want YOU to choose whatever tempo you want. Continue to
use a metronome to make sure you stay on beat with whatever tempo you
pick though. Note that the second repeat is associated with the whole
pattern (as marked by the square brackets).

**4/4 time**

\[ { B ts / Pch ts / k / k } \|\|

{ B ts / Pch ts / B ts / Pch ts }

{ B ts / t / - dsh / - dsh } \] \|\|

Recording 9: Semi-Random Beat Pattern
=====================================

Choose one of the following 3 beats to perform at your choice of tempo.

**Beat A**

{ B t / B - / B ts / B - }{ B rrh / K t t B / K t t B / Pch } \|\|

**Beat B**

{ ts ts / \^Ksh ts / ts ts / \^Ksh ts }{ ts ts / \^Ksh ts / Pch - t /
Pch - Pch }

{ ts ts / \^Ksh ts / ts ts / \^Ksh ts }{ Pch t t/ Pch - B / Pch - B /
Pch } {dsh / - / - / -}

**Beat C**

{ BB / Pf k t k / B k t k / Pf }{ BB / Pf k t k / B k t k / Pf Pf }

{ BB / Pf k t k / B k t k / Pf }{ BB / Pf k t k / BB BB / dsh }

Recording 10: Random Beat Pattern (Unknown)
===========================================

Make up your own beat (using only sounds from the vocabulary list) at
your choice of tempo. You don't have to use a metronome this time; we
want you to free up and be natural here. Try to keep the pattern under
20 seconds.
